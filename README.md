# Random Card Generator

The **Random Card Generator** is a Python project that generates random cards with a graphical interface. This project was created as part of my **Computer Graphics** class during my second year of college. It demonstrates the use of the **Pygame** library for rendering and interaction, along with the **random** module for card selection.

## 🃏 About the Project
This program dynamically generates random cards, showcasing how to handle graphical assets and randomness in Python. The project is a fun and interactive way to explore concepts like image rendering and event-driven programming.

## 🚀 Features
- **Random Card Selection**: Draws a random card each time.
- **Graphical Interface**: Uses Pygame for rendering cards.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Easy to set up and use.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Modules**:
  - [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) (for graphics and user interaction)
  - [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) (for random card generation)

## 📦 Installation and Setup
To run the Random Card Generator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaveTron4/Random-Card-Generator.git
   cd Random-Card-Generator

2. Install the required dependencies: Ensure Python is installed, then install Pygame:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

This project helped me:

- Understand how to work with graphical assets in Pygame.
- Learn event-driven programming using Pygame's loop structure.
- Implement randomization effectively using the `random` module.
